I studied in a French Engineering school (ENSTA-ParisTEch, in Paris) with a major in Physical Oceanography. I also studied Climatology during my master in USQV (Versailles, France). 
For two years, I am working in LGGE (Grenoble, France) with Jacques Verron and Pierre Brasseur on the assimilation of tracer images for the control of the dynamic in the ocean.

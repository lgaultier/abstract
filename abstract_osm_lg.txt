Nowadays, many satellite observations of the ocean are available. Thus, altimetric satellites reveal turbulent dynamics at the mesoscale. Additionally, high resolution sensors of bio-geochemical tracers such as the Sea Surface Temperature or the Ocean Color reveal even smaller structures at the sub-mesoscale, which are not detected by altimetric satellites.  
These two types of scales (mesoscale and sub-mesoscale) and two types of products (altimetric field and tracer image) are representation of the same physical and bio-geochemical reality of the ocean. 
In this study, we benefit from these two types of complementary observations to refine the estimation of the ocean circulation, so that it takes into account the available mesoscale and sub-mesoscale information. 
More specifically, we use the Finite-Size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLEs) to extract the sub-mesoscale filaments from the turbulent mesoscale velocity field. 
Comparing the FSLEs and the tracer patterns, we can inject sub-mesoscale tracer information in the  FSLEs image and invert this image to retrieve the corresponding velocity. 
Therefore, this process improve the definition of mesoscale currents from altimetry and the knowledge of vertical motions that are essential to good biogeochemical modeling using both altimetric mesoscale observations and sub-mesoscale tracer images.
